# Rightpoint - SubscribePro External Vaulting Solution for CardConnect
This module is responsible for extending the Blackridge Software module as maintained and enhanced by Rightpoint per 
the requirements of Garden of Life to provide external vaulting capabilities.

The primary function is to allow SubscribePro to have access to payment tokens generated by the CardConnect gateway
and returned to Adobe Commerce. SubscribePro requires these payment tokens to place recurring subscription orders via
the Adobe Commerce Customer API (REST).
